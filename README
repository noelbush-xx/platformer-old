Welcome to Platformer.

What is here at this moment is still in formation.  I'm building up an example
implementation of a Platformer node using webmachine
(http://bitbucket.org/basho/webmachine), and a basic web client for testing it.
Once this is more fleshed out I'll document what's going on here.

Custom Headers
--------------
These are the custom HTTP headers involved in some Platformer messages between nodes or between nodes and clients:

X-Platformer-Message-Token:      A v4 uuid used to track the history of a message as it is passed along
X-Platformer-Message-Priority:   An integer counting down from (TBD: 3?) used in message propagation
X-Platformer-Message-Source:     A string used to identify a node that is making a request to another node
